\chapter{Impegno risorse e pianificazione dell'attivit√†}

This chapter contains useful information for the preparation and the presentation of the master degree thesis for students of Electronic Engineering (M61), at the University of Study of Naples Federico II.

The final test for the Master Degree course in Electronic Engineering consists in the preparation and discussion of a thesis, written with the help of a supervisor (eventually with one or two co-supervisors). This work is the final result of the student career and it testifies his/her ability in exploring in deep the topics encountered during the degree course.
