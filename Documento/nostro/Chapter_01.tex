\chapter{Modello funzionale}

This chapter contains useful information for the preparation and the presentation of the master degree thesis for students of Electronic Engineering (M61), at the University of Study of Naples Federico II.

The final test for the Master Degree course in Electronic Engineering consists in the preparation and discussion of a thesis, written with the help of a supervisor (eventually with one or two co-supervisors). This work is the final result of the student career and it testifies his/her ability in exploring in deep the topics encountered during the degree course.

\section{Modellazione dei casi d'uso}

The supervisor is one of the professors that the candidate encountered during the degree course. Usually, the student finds its supervisor through informal talks, once provided that the professor is available and the student is interested in the professor's topics of interest. The degree course, on its website \url{www.ingegneria-elettronica.unina.it}, has defined a page with a non-esaustive list of available theses topics, in order to facilitate the information exchange between students and professors.

In case the thesis is developed after an intra-moenia internship, among one of the laboratories of the departement, the tutor that has already followed the student during the internship becomes the supervisor.

The supervisor defines the thesis topic. As already mentioned, the supervisor can be helped by one (or two maximum) co-supervisor. Supervisor and co-supervisor must guide and assist the student during the thesis developement and also provide him all the needed methodological and practical instruments. During the thesis are usually foreseen periodical meetings of the candidate with the supervisor, during which the ongoing work and the obtained results are discussed, also to define the future steps of the work.

\section{Mockup}

The redaction of the thesis has to be carried on by the candidate indipendentely. A dissertation type thesis has the structure of a scientific article where it is required to derive, from the international literature, the most recent developments on the topic of interest, it is required to synthsize them, present them in an omogenous way, and finally compare the different approaches highlighting pros and cons of each of them. A sperimental type thesis has the structure of a scientific report, it faces a specific problem, typically within a more wide project of interest forthe supervisor, proposing a solution that is innovative if compared to the state of the art. A sperimental thesis also includes a validation of the proposed solution, made by means of experimental measuraments and/or numerical simulations.
