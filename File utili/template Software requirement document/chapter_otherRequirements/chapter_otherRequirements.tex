that are pertinent to the project.$>$

\section{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary

a single project in each SRS.$>$

$<$Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow
diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship
diagrams.$>$
