\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class,
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{System Feature 1}
$<$Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few
words.$>$

\subsection{Description and Priority}
$<$Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of
High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a
relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).$>$

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
$<$List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the
behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements
associated with use cases.$>$

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
$<$Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature.
These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user
to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case.
Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or
invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous,
verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary
information is not yet available.$>$

$<$Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a
meaningful tag of some kind.$>$
